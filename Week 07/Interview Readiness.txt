Is SVM (Support Vector Machine) a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm?
	Supervised

Why is SVM such a powerful classification method?
	It find the best plane the seperates all data points from one class to others.

What are 3 disadvantages of SVMs?
	High Training time
	Very picky, has to have very clean, differentiated data
	doesnt provide probability estimates

What is the time complexity of SVM?
	O(n3)
What is it for Logistic Regression?
	O(d)

Explain feature importance for the Random Forest algorithm?

When examining feature importance, what is Gini impurity or information gain?

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model, what is it and how does it work?
	Its a method of explaining the output of machine learning models using the game theory concept. it calculates the contribution of each feature to the end result prediction
